# Changelog

All notable changes to the Smart Calendar PWA project.

## [2.0.0] - 2024-01-15

This release transforms the calendar from a read-only viewer to a fully-functional calendar management system with Hebrew NLP capabilities.

### Added

#### Backend (Google Apps Script)
- **Full Calendar CRUD Operations**
  - ✅ Create events with full options (attendees, reminders, colors, location)
  - ✅ Read/Find events with filtering (time range, search query, max results)
  - ✅ Update events with partial updates and attendee merge/replace modes
  - ✅ Delete events by ID
  - ✅ Get single event by ID

- **Hebrew Natural Language Processing**
  - ✅ v1 Heuristic parsing with automatic event creation (`text` action)
  - ✅ v2 Tokenization and parsing preview (`parseOnly` action)
  - ✅ Date support: היום (today), מחר (tomorrow), מחרתיים (day after tomorrow)
  - ✅ Time support: HH:MM and HH formats
  - ✅ Location extraction using ב preposition
  - ✅ Smart summary extraction from Hebrew text

- **REST API (doPost)**
  - ✅ JSON-based POST API with 8 actions
  - ✅ Standardized response format with `ok` status field
  - ✅ Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages
  - ✅ Input validation for all actions
  - ✅ Actions: selfTest, findEvents, createEvent, updateEvent, deleteEvent, getEvent, text, parseOnly

- **Enhanced Legacy API (doGet)**
  - ✅ Backward-compatible GET endpoints
  - ✅ Improved error messages for unknown modes
  - ✅ Added event IDs to events response

#### Frontend (PWA)
- **Enhanced Service Worker**
  - ✅ Network-first strategy for Apps Script API calls
  - ✅ Cache-first strategy for static assets
  - ✅ Automatic old cache cleanup
  - ✅ Graceful offline error handling
  - ✅ Version bumped to v4

#### Documentation
- ✅ **README.md** - Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- ✅ **OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md** - Daily operations, monitoring, and troubleshooting
- ✅ **NLP_GUIDE.md** - Hebrew NLP patterns, examples, and best practices
- ✅ **TEST_EXAMPLES.md** - API test examples and automated test scripts
- ✅ **CHANGELOG.md** - This file

### Changed

#### OAuth Scopes
- 🔄 Changed from `calendar.readonly` to full `calendar` scope
- ✅ Enables write operations (create, update, delete)
- ⚠️ Requires user re-authorization after deployment

#### Service Worker
- 🔄 Cache version changed from `yaniv-v3` to `yaniv-v4`
- ✅ Improved caching strategies for better performance
- ✅ Better handling of Apps Script API calls

#### Code Structure
- 🔄 Complete rewrite of `Code.gs` (from 24 to 556 lines)
- ✅ Modular function structure
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling throughout
- ✅ Better code organization with JSDoc comments

### Fixed

#### Issues Resolved
- ✅ Buttons like 'אירועי היום' now functional with doPost API
- ✅ Calendar write operations now work (create/update/delete)
- ✅ Proper error responses for invalid requests
- ✅ Better handling of edge cases in Hebrew NLP
- ✅ Service worker now properly handles API calls

### Security

- ✅ Maintained OAuth 2.0 authentication
- ✅ All operations execute as authenticated user
- ✅ No data stored in Apps Script (uses user's calendar directly)
- ✅ Proper scope declarations in appsscript.json

### Performance

- ✅ Limited maxResults to 200 to prevent abuse
- ✅ Efficient event serialization
- ✅ Smart caching strategy in service worker
- ✅ Fast Hebrew text parsing (< 100ms)

### Technical Details

#### Files Changed
- `src/appsscript.json` - OAuth scope update
- `src/Code.gs` - Complete rewrite with full API
- `sw.js` - Enhanced caching strategies

#### Files Added
- `README.md` - 13,936 characters
- `OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md` - 8,627 characters
- `NLP_GUIDE.md` - 12,886 characters
- `TEST_EXAMPLES.md` - 11,992 characters
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file

#### Statistics
- Lines of code added: ~2,200+
- Functions added: 15+ new functions
- API endpoints: 10 total (2 GET legacy + 8 POST actions)
- Documentation pages: 5

### Migration Guide

#### For Existing Users

1. **Re-authorization Required**
   - After deployment, users must re-authorize the app
   - New scope allows calendar write operations

2. **API Changes**
   - Legacy GET API (`?mode=selftest` and `?mode=events`) still works
   - New POST API available for all operations
   - Response format now includes `ok` field

3. **Service Worker Update**
   - Clear browser cache or hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - New service worker will auto-install

#### For Developers

1. **Deployment**
   ```bash
   clasp push
   clasp deploy
   ```

2. **Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test selftest endpoint
   curl "YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL?mode=selftest"
   
   # Test POST API
   curl -X POST YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"action":"selfTest"}'
   ```

3. **Update Frontend**
   - If using custom frontend, update iframe src to new deployment URL
   - Implement API calls using new POST format

### Breaking Changes

⚠️ **OAuth Scope Change**
- Users must re-authorize the application
- Calendar read-only access is now full calendar access

⚠️ **Service Worker Cache Version**
- Old cache (v3) will be cleared automatically
- May cause brief re-download of assets

### Known Limitations

#### Hebrew NLP
- Only supports: today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow (no specific dates)
- Only supports: HH:MM and HH time formats (no am/pm text)
- Fixed 1-hour duration for all NLP-created events
- Location extraction is basic (may not capture full multi-word locations)

#### API
- maxResults capped at 200 for findEvents
- No recurring event support yet
- No multiple calendar support (uses default calendar only)

### Future Roadmap

#### Planned for v2.1
- [ ] Enhanced date parsing (specific dates, day names, weeks)
- [ ] Custom duration support in Hebrew text
- [ ] Improved location extraction for multi-word locations
- [ ] Recurring event support

#### Planned for v2.2
- [ ] Multiple calendar support
- [ ] Rich text descriptions
- [ ] Conflict detection
- [ ] Smart scheduling suggestions

#### Planned for v3.0
- [ ] Machine learning for Hebrew NLP
- [ ] Voice input support
- [ ] Advanced analytics
- [ ] Team calendar features
